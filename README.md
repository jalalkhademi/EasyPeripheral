# Easy Peripheral

I am trying to add an abstraction layer on top of BLE SDK. So that it is simplified to scan, connect and transfer data to peripheral and viceversa.
The architecture of application foresees SDK design compatibility. So that it contains implementation package and SDK package which are loosly couples.

### Prerequisites

this project requires java version 8 and the minimum android sdk version is 18.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

test development is under construction.
